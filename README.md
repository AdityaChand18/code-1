# code-1
This is my first submission. Too basic, but will boost my confidence in coding.  
IN MK1, I have made code which will calculate taylors expansion of e^x, sinx and cosx. The best part of this is that while making , I haven't used the concept of recurssion (for calculating factorial otherwise the code would have been much easier). I have done this to challenge myself, and I think I completed the task very efficiently.
